The windows binaries only include `csaf_uploader` and `csaf_checker`.

### Prebuild binaries

Download the binaries (from the most recent release assets on Github).


### Build from sources

- A recent version of **Go** (1.17+) should be installed. [Go installation](https://go.dev/doc/install)

- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/csaf-poc/csaf_distribution.git `

- Build Go components Makefile supplies the following targets:
	- Build For GNU/Linux System: `make build_linux`
	- Build For Windows System (cross build): `make build_win`
    - Build For both linux and windows: `make build`
	- Build from a specific github tag by passing the intended tag to the `BUILDTAG` variable.
	   E.g. `make BUILDTAG=v1.0.0 build` or `make BUILDTAG=1 build_linux`.
     The special value `1` means checking out the highest github tag for the build.
    - Remove the generated binaries und their directories: `make mostlyclean`

Binaries will be placed in directories named like `bin-linux-amd64/` and `bin-windows-amd64/`.

## csaf_aggregator

### Usage

```
  csaf_aggregator [OPTIONS]

Application Options:
  -c, --config=CFG-FILE    File name of the configuration file (default:
                           aggregator.toml)
      --version            Display version of the binary
  -i, --interim            Perform an interim scan

Help Options:
  -h, --help               Show this help message
```

Usage example for a single run, to test if the config is good:
```bash
./csaf_aggregator -c docs/examples/aggregator.toml
```

Once the config is good, you can run the aggregator periodically
in two modes. For instance using `cron` on Ubuntu and after placing
the config file in `/etc/csaf_aggregator.toml` and making sure
its permissions only allow the user `www-data` to read it:

```bash
chown www-data /etc/csaf_aggregator.toml
chmod go-rwx /etc/csaf_aggregator.toml

mkdir /var/log/csaf_aggregator
mkdir ~www-data/bin
cp bin-linux-amd64/csaf_aggregator ~www-data/bin/
chown www-data.www-data -R ~www-data/bin /var/log/csaf_aggregator

# list current crontab
crontab -u www-data -l
# edit crontab (add lines like example below)
crontab -u www-data -e
```

Crontab example, running the full mode one a day and updating
interim advisories every 60 minutes:

```crontab
SHELL=/bin/bash
# run full mode in the night at 04:00
0 4 * * * $HOME/bin/csaf_aggregator --config /etc/csaf_aggregator.toml >> /var/log/csaf_aggregator/full.log 2>&1
# run in interim mode once per hour at 30 minutes, e.g. 00:30, 01:30, ...
30 0-23 * * * $HOME/bin/csaf_aggregator --config /etc/csaf_aggregator.toml --interim >> /var/log/csaf_aggregator/interim.log 2>&1
```


#### serve via web server

Serve the paths where the aggregator writes its `html/` output
by means of a webserver.
In the config example below place is configured by the path given for `web`.

The user running the aggregator has to be able to write there
and the web server must be able to read the files.

If you are using nginx, the setup instructions for the provider provide
and example. You can leave out the cgi-bin part,
potentially commend out the TLS client parts and
adjust the `root` path accordingly.


### config options

The following options can be used in the config file in TOML format:

```go
workers               // number of parallel workers to start (default 10)
folder                // target folder on disc for writing the downloaded documents
web                   // directory to be served by the webserver
domain                // base url where the contents will be reachable from outside
rate                  // overall downloading limit per worker
insecure              // do not check validity of TLS certificates
write_indices         // write index.txt and changes.csv
openpgp_private_key   // OpenPGP private key (must have no passphrase set, if
                      // you want to be able to run unattended, e.g. via cron.)
openpgp_public_key    // OpenPGP public key
passphrase            // passphrase of the OpenPGP key
lock_file             // path to lockfile, to stop other instances if one is not done
interim_years         // limiting the years for which interim documents are searched
verbose               // print more diagnostic output, e.g. https request
allow_single_provider // debugging option
remote_validator      // use remote validation checker
aggregator            // table with basic infos for the aggregator object
providers             // array of tables, each entry to be mirrored or listed
```

At least 2 providers have to be configured. The other options are optional.

Rates are specified as floats in HTTPS operations per second.
0 means no limit. The rates can be specified per provider. Any provider
which has no specified rate will use the configured default. If
no default was configured, the internal default with no limits is used.

`providers` is an array of tables, each allowing
```
name
domain
rate
insecure
write_indices
category
update_interval
```

Any provider needs a valid name and domain. The other
options are optional.

If you want an entry to be listed instead of mirrored
in a `aggregator.category == "aggregator"` instance,
set `category` to `lister` in the entry.
Otherwise it is recommended to not set `category` for entries.

If a provider's domain starts with `https://` it is considered a publisher.
These publishers are added to the `csaf_publishers` list, written
to the resulting `aggregator.json`.
Each publisher must announce an `update_interval` there.
This can be configured for each entry, by the config option with the same name.
If not given it is taken from the configured default
Otherwise, the internal default "on best effort" is used.

If a provider's `create_service_document` option is set to true,
a `service.json` will be written listing its ROLIE feed documents.
If it is not set or set to false, then no `service.json` will be written.

To offer an easy way of assorting CSAF documents by criteria like 
document category, languages or values of the branch category within
the product tree, ROLIE category values can be configured. This can either
be done using an array of strings taken literally or, by prepending `"expr:"`. 
The latter is evaluated as JSONPath and the result will be added into the 
categories document. For a more detailed explanation and examples,
[refer to the provider config](csaf_provider.md#provider-options).

#### Publish others' advisories

In case you want to provide CSAF advisories from others
that only qualify as CSAF publishers, see
[how to use the `csaf_aggregator` as "CSAF proxy provider"](proxy-provider-for-aggregator.md).

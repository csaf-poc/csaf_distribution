Will download all CSAF documents for the given _domains_, by trying each as a CSAF provider.

If a _domain_ starts with `https://` it is instead considered a direct URL to the `provider-metadata.json` and downloading procedes from there.

Increasing the number of workers opens more connections to the web servers
to download more advisories at once. This may improve the overall speed of the download.
However, since this also increases the load on the servers, their administrators could
have taken countermeasures to limit this.

If no config file is explictly given the follwing places are searched for a config file:
```
~/.config/csaf/downloader.ini
~/.csaf_downloader.ini
csaf_downloader.ini
```

with `~` expanding to `$HOME` on unixoid systems and `%HOMEPATH` on Windows systems.

Supported options in config files:
```
directory         # not set by default
insecure          = false
ignoresigcheck    = false
verbose           = false
# rate            # set to unlimited
worker            = 2
# header          # not set by default
# validator       # not set by default
# validatorcache  # not set by default
validatorpreset   = "mandatory"
```
